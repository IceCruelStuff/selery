## Reporting issues

SEL is not perfect and sometimes may not work properly.
When this happens you can open an issue reporting your problem and, possibly the crash file generated by SEL.

Make sure your issue matches the following requirements:
* Do not report an issue if there is already a similar one opened.
* Do not report issues caused by plugins or forks.
* Do not report issues that have not been caused by the latest version of SEL (released or in development).
* If you have a crash file, paste the stack trace in the issue's description.
* Use descriptive titles, avoid titles like "issue", "crash" or "bug".
* Do not report an issue if haven't a crash file or the instructions on how to reproduce the issue
* Write in english

For protocol issues, report an issue on [sel-utils](https://github.com/sel-project/sel-utils).

For issues on the manager, report an issue on [sel-manager](https://github.com/sel-project/sel-manager).

## Suggestions

If you'd like to see some new feature in SEL you can suggest it by opening an issue which title starts with `Suggestion:` and describe it in the issue's description.
**DO NOT** create issues suggesting to add missing gameplay features. We already know what is missing.

Example of an ideal suggestion:
> #### Suggestion: json configuration files
> The template Config in sel.plugin allows to read and write configuration files in plain format, which is limited to basic types and doesn't support multiple lines.
> JSON configuration files would be more ordered and easy to mantain.

## Code

You can contribute to SEL's source code fixing issues, adding new features or improve them and fixing typos.

Before creating any pull request verify that your code has the following requirements:
* The code style must follow the [D style](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html), with some exceptions:
	* Constants, when static members of a `class` (and not an `enum`) must be in uppercase snake case and not camel cased.
	* Variable name `vers` should be used instead of `version_`
* Every public function, method, class, struct and enum must be documented in english.
* Avoid the use of public variables in favour of documented `@property` methods (for getting and setting).
* Opening braces must be on the same line of the declaration, spaced from it.
* Every file must start with the licence declaration.
* The word `SEL` must always be uppercase in the documentation and lowercase in the code.
