SEL is based on the [hub-node communication protocol](https://sel-utils.github.io/protocol/hncom), which means that it can run as two separate instances (hub and node), which are connected through a socket.

## Create a server

:warning: does not work with DMD >=2.074

:warning: doesn't compile using 32-bit DMD

:warning: doesn't work using DMD in release mode

```
git clone git://github.com/sel-project/selery
cd selery/builder
dub --single init.d
dub build
cd ..
./selery-default [-edu] [-realm]
```

If you're on Windows you must compile using a 64-bit architecture (for example `dub build -a x86_64`)
